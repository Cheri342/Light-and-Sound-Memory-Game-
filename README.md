## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- No outside resources were used to complete my submisson. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- A challenge I faced when creating a submission for my Prework was exporting my project to Github. This is my first time using Github to export my project from Glitch. I have done several projects on my own and have shared them on my Github but I do not have a full understanding of all the features Github provides. I was relieved that CodePath has provided me a video demonstrating how to export the project correctly and all the other important aspects Github offers. Furthermore, Glitch was also a challenge for me to work on the project since I have never used this website in my computer science studies. However, I was able to overcome this problem easily from all the information and steps that were provided to me by CodePath. From this, I learned additional topics in HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I did not realize prior to the project. I have also used my own logic to add additional features to my project to completely acknowledge all topics and remember to use them in future projects. Lastly, another challenge I have faced was uploading my interview video. I have done several interviews for internships or jobs and did exceedingly well in them from practicing often by myself or with an intended audience like my academic advisors or a group of students. However, I have not experienced doing an interview where I had to record myself for five minutes answering a set of questions. I was comfortable answering all the questions in my video but it was a challenge to get my video to five minutes. But, I spent a majority of my time to answer each question with a brief explanation and provided examples to overcome the issue. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- After completing my prework submission I had several doubts regarding to the web development of the project. For example, is it necessary to include a css file? I have created a few websites where I added style to each element simply by putting it inside the tag. For example, I can use the style attribute to add color and font for h1, p, body, etc.. I also had a doubt on adding images to my websites or projects on how to edit the image using css if the image was found online. For instance, I would like to know how to resize and add style to the image using css. Lastly, is Javascript the only language I can use to corporate HTML and CSS or can I use other languages like Python or Java to build mobile apps, online games, etc.? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had more time to work on this project, I would add many exciting features to improve the overall game. I would have changed the speed of the time each button was played more quickly so users do not have to wait briefly for their turn. With the slow timing users could feel less excited to play and the game would take longer to complete. I would also have added different patterns each time a user has played so users do not get bored in playing the same pattern each time. Lastly, I would add 3 strikes so each user can make 2 mistakes before losing the game. Overall, I would have made changes in my Javascript functions (playClueSequence, guess, startGame, etc.) and change the values of my global constants to perform all these features.
